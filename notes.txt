PI_Camera
-server
--receives requests

NAS
-Client
--requests a picture be taken
--writes data to file
--returns file name

-Boss
--Every 60s take a pic via client
--every 70s take a pic via client
--If request from php program, take a pic on demand

if t=60:
	take pic
	t=0
elif (shared mem check)
	take pic
	write file location to pic label
	take pic
else
	sleep 1
	t=t+1

need to create a new venv on NAS to run this program, had to install python 3.8, which is what supports shared-memory-dict
