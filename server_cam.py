'''
This program is the server and runs on the picamera.  It is activeated when a request comes in.
This program:
-This program listens on a port.  
-When a request is received the program takes a picture and converts to an RGB stream
-Sends back to the client.

Server: PiCamera 192.168.1.227
Client: PiNAS 192.168.1.9
